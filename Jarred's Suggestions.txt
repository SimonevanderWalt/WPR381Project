1. The weather API has alot of almost useless info so request this in the back end API then process the data to whats needed by the front end and
    send only the needed data in an object

Heres a couple other suggestions I have for you to do on top on the initial requirements of the project


1.Implement https with a working certificate on the web_server part of the project you can combine the https thing he teaches you with express to
get a working certificate which you can view in your browser. This got me a couple bonus marks with tendai

2. Take a look at sending parameters through the request body/ response body when communicating between the front end react and the back end api.
    This allows parameters to be encrypted when sent over https. This is better than your params being visble as plain text in the request link
    which can be viewed by anyone monitoring the network e.g. https://foo.com/passcheck?password=1234 (password is clearly visible if done this way)

3. Take a look at react router when dealing with error pages. basically it will check for all links you want then if it cant find it it will return
    a defult page which can be your 404 page

If in doubt hit me up and I'll always be willing to help
